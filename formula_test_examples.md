## Handling Duplicate Numbers
When multiple formulas generate the same number, the amounts should be combined:

Example: If "AP500" and "7NP600" both generate number "77":
- From AP: 77 with 500
- From NP: 77 with 600
- **Final result:** 77 with 1,100 (combined amount)

This applies whenever multiple formulas or number groups in a single input generate the same number. The number should appear once in the final list with the sum of all its amounts.

- 00, 22, 44, 66, 88 with 400 each (SP) - 5 numbers, 2,000 total
- 11, 33, 55, 77, 99 with 300 each (MP) - 5 numbers, 1,500 total
- 45, 54, 67, 76, 89, 98 with 500 each (regular numbers) - 6 numbers, 3,000 total

**Overlap Analysis - Numbers appearing in multiple formulas:**
- 00: AP(500) + SP(400) = 900
- 05: BR(300) + PW(400) = 700
- 07: NK(350) + NP7(600) = 950
- 10, 21, 32: ညီကို(500) (also appear in other formulas)
- 11: AP(500) + TS(200) + MP(300) = 1,000
- 22: AP(500) + SP(400) = 900
- 33: AP(500) + MP(300) = 800
- 44: AP(500) + SP(400) = 900
- 45, 54: K(500) + regular(500) = 1,000
- 50: BR(300) + PW(400) = 700
- 55: AP(500) + MP(300) = 800
- 66: AP(500) + SP(400) = 900
- 77: AP(500) + NP7(600) + MP(300) + KP(600) = 2,000
- 88: AP(500) + SP(400) = 900
- 99: AP(500) + MP(300) + KP(600) = 1,400

**Final Stats After Combining Duplicates:**
- Unique numbers: approximately 50 (reduced from 107 due to overlap)
- Total bet amount: 45,200 (unchanged - sum of all original amounts)
- Average amount per number: approximately 904

## Summary of All Examples
- Total distinct betting patterns: 33
- Approximate total unique numbers across all examples: 200 (accounting for duplicates)
- Total betting amount: 150,000+
